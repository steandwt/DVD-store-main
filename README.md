# DVD-store-main

This is one of two parts that form a DVD store rental system that incorporates a SQLite database which I made for an University assignment

In order to run this application you first need to download my Create-DVD-store-database repository. 
The Create-DVD-store-database repositoy is responsible for setting up the SQLite database, create the needed tables
as well as populate them with the given .ser files (This was all specifications of the assignment). 

After the database is created you can run the DVD-Store-main program which will open a filechooser where you need to select 
the created .db file from the Create-DVD-store-database aaplication.

Enjoy
